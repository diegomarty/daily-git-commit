## 📋 What is this repository about? 📋

This repository is automated with a **GitHub Action** that is programmed to perform a unique task:

Every day, at precisely 22:00 UTC, this GitHub Action springs into action. It performs a simple yet effective operation: it updates this README file.

## 🔄 What does the update involve? 🔄

During each update, a new line of text is appended at the end of this file. This line is a timestamp, marking the date and time at which the update was made. And to add a touch of fun to each update, a random emoji is included.

But that's not all! The same random emoji is also included in the commit message for that update.

## ⏳ How long will this continue? ⏳

This GitHub Action is set to continue its daily tasks until the end of the year 2024.
